## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed commands, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!
