# Contributing to Trailhead-Stats

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed commands, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the [BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE)

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel
free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/nabondance/Trailhead-Stats/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/nabondance/Trailhead-Stats/issues/new/choose);
it's that easy!
